# AI-Driven-3D-Medical-Imaging
This project helps doctors see 3D models of organs using simple 2D scans like X-rays or ultrasound. It works by turning these 2D images into 3D views, so doctors can better check if an organ might fail. This is especially useful for hospitals that donâ€™t have expensive machines like MRI or CT scans.
